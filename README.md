# JBL-SoundTgr (JBL Sound Triggerer)
Simple iOS app that automatically finds, connects to, and sends a command through a private protocol to play a private sound effect on JBL speakers.

# How do I install this app?
You can find the .ipa for the app in the [releases](https://github.com/XboxOneSogie720/JBL-SoundTgr/releases). To run it, sideload it onto an iOS device running iOS 15.5 or up and follow the on-screen instructions. **Make sure your speaker is turned on and connected to the device before you open the app.**

# Why did I make this?
I don't really know. I found a cool discussion pannel about the communication protocol for JBL's older speakers (pre-partyboost, I don't think those ones work with this app) and wanted to utilize a Swift app to send one of the commands.
